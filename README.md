_I vvant to make a virtual audio processing graph_

This is a project in early development for a suite of useful TypeScript packages on top of the Web Audio API, primarily a virtual audio graph that is framework-agnostic, though a React library will be prioritized on top of the core virtual graph package.

There is a current experiment with providing a complete mock of the Web Audio API for unit testing.

VVeb Audio is not accepting outside contributors at this time.
